\section{Introduction}
This report describes how I implemented the game of Tag. The game consists of a number of rooms (Bailiffs), the Bailiffs are contained in separate JVM instances. Each Bailiff serves as an execution environment for mobile agents (the Players). A player has two states: \textbf{it} and \textbf{not it}. At any given time there can only be one \textbf{it} player, which I will refer to as a \textbf{tagger}. The purpose of the tagger is simple; tag others, i.e pass the \textbf{it} property to another player. The player can only tag another player if they both reside in the same Bailiff. So the tagger needs to find a populated Bailiff, move to it, and try to tag someone. The non-tagger players simply need to avoid the tagger, i.e avoid bailiffs where the tagger is present.

\section{Tagger strategy}
The following is the strategy of the Tagger agent:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Check for players in the current bailiff
	\item dsa
\end{enumerate}
